# Overview

This is my .vim directory.

# How To Use

**NOTE: this will overwrite your existing setup: make sure this is what you want!**

1. `cd ~`
1. `git clone https://github.com:billgathen/billgathen_dot_vim.git .vim`
1. `ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc`

Close any existing vim instances and restart.

The first time, Vundle will install current versions of all the plugins automatically.

You should be good to go!
