The <tt>Enumerable</tt> mixin provides collection classes with several
traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must
provide a method <tt>each</tt>, which yields successive members of the
collection. If <tt>Enumerable#max</tt>, <tt>#min</tt>, or <tt>#sort</tt> is
used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful
<tt><=></tt> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of
the collection.
